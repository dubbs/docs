title: Dev Toolbar
---

Astro includes a development toolbar at the bottom of every page. This toolbar includes a number of useful tools ("apps") for debugging and inspecting your site during development, and can be extended using [Astro integrations](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) with the [Dev Toolbar API](/en/reference/dev-toolbar-app-reference/).

This toolbar is enabled by default, appears when you hover over the bottom of the page, and will only appear in development mode. It is not included in the final build of your site.

## Built-in apps

### Astro

The Astro app provides easy access to different information about the current project and links about Astro. Notably, it provides a one-click access to the Astro documentation, GitHub repository, and Discord server.

This app also include a "Copy debug info" button, which will copy the output of the [`astro info`](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-info) command to your clipboard. This can be useful when asking for help or reporting issues.

### X-ray

The X-ray app allows you to inspect the [Islands](/en/concepts/islands/) on the current page, showing you the properties that are being passed to each island, and the client directive that is being used to render them.

### Audits

The Audits app runs a series of audits on the current page, checking for common performance and accessibility issues. When an issue is found, a red dot will appear in the toolbar, and the issue will be highlighted in the page once you click on the app.

:::note
The performance and accessibility audits done by the dev toolbar are intentionally not as comprehensive as those provided by dedicated tools like [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) or [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), or even better, humans.

The dev toolbar aims to provide a quick and easy way to catch common issues during development, without needing to context-switch to a different tool.

### Settings

The Settings app allows you to toggle different settings for the development toolbar, such as verbose logging, and the ability to disable notifications.

## Extending the dev toolbar

[Astro integrations](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) can add new apps to the dev toolbar, allowing you to extend it with custom tools that are specific to your project. To see a list of integrations that provide dev toolbar apps, see the "Dev Toolbar" section of the [integrations list](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=toolbar).

## Disabling the dev toolbar

### Per-project

To disable the dev toolbar for everyone working on a project, you can set `devToolbar: false` in your project's [config file](/en/reference/configuration-reference/).

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  devToolbar: {
    enabled: false
  }
})
```

### Per-user

If you want to disable the dev toolbar for yourself on a specific project, you can do so using the `astro preferences` command.

```shell
astro preferences disable devToolbar
```

To disable the dev toolbar in all Astro projects for a user on the current machine:

```shell
astro preferences disable --global devToolbar
```

The dev toolbar can later be enabled with:

```shell
astro preferences enable devToolbar
```
